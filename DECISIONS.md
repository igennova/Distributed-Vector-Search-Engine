## Phase 0 — brute-force baseline
- Metric: cosine similarity (direction, magnitude-independent) over raw dot product.
- Bug caught: unit tests passed but benchmark recall was 0.734 — I'd implemented
  dot product, not cosine. Tiny tests used unit vectors (where they're identical);
  only the benchmark's varied magnitudes exposed it.
- Baseline @ 10k vectors: recall 1.000, p50 12ms, 80 QPS. Scales linearly →
  the motivation for an ANN index in Phase 1.
