## Phase 0 — brute-force baseline
- Metric: cosine similarity (direction, magnitude-independent) over raw dot product.
- Bug caught: unit tests passed but benchmark recall was 0.734 — I'd implemented
  dot product, not cosine. Tiny tests used unit vectors (where they're identical);
  only the benchmark's varied magnitudes exposed it.
- Baseline @ 10k vectors: recall 1.000, p50 12ms, 80 QPS. Scales linearly →
  the motivation for an ANN index in Phase 1.

## HNSW index (graph-based ANN)
- Structure: hierarchical navigable small-world graph. Search greedily descends the
  sparse upper layers, then runs a beam search (`ef_search`) on the dense layer 0.
- Neighbor selection on insert: simple M-nearest, with bounded degree (2M at layer 0,
  M above) to keep search cost bounded. The paper's diversity heuristic would give
  better recall per `ef` and is a candidate future improvement.
- Recall is tunable at query time via `ef_search` with no rebuild — the recall/latency knob.
  @ 10k vectors, dim 128: ef=50 → 0.56 recall @ 1.8ms; ef=200 → 0.93 @ 5.2ms;
  ef=400 → 0.99 @ 8.3ms (vs brute force 1.00 @ 12.9ms).
- Caveat: the dataset is 128-dim random Gaussian, a near-worst case for ANN (points are
  nearly equidistant), so it needs a higher `ef` than real, clustered embeddings would.
